            <p class="about-text">Eccentric scientist Rintarou Okabe has a never-ending thirst for scientific exploration. Together with his ditzy but well-meaning friend Mayuri Shiina and his roommate Itaru Hashida, Rintarou founds the Future Gadget Laboratory in the hopes of creating technological innovations that baffle the human psyche. Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable "gadget" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.
                <br /><br />
                However, when Rintarou decides to attend neuroscientist Kurisu Makise's conference on time travel, he experiences a series of strange events that lead him to believe that there is more to the "Phone Microwave" gadget than meets the eye. Apparently able to send text messages into the past using the microwave, Rintarou dabbles further with the "time machine," attracting the ire and attention of the mysterious organization SERN.
                <br /><br />
                Due to the novel discovery, Rintarou and his friends find themselves in an ever-present danger. As he works to mitigate the damage his invention has caused to the timeline, he is not only fighting a battle to save his loved ones, but also one against his degrading sanity.</p>

                        <br /><br />
                        Okabe is a theatrical and eccentric individual. He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who likes to assume his "true name" "Kyouma Hououin" (鳳凰院凶真, Hououin Kyouma), and often uses this to introduce himself to others. Usually, people do not care and instead address him by his actual name or by 'Okarin' (his nickname), much to his chagrin.</td>

                    <td>18</td>
                    <td>The female protagonist. Kurisu is a research member in Victor Qondria University's Brain Research Program. Her age group matches that of third-year high schoolers, but she skipped a grade through America's educational system. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        She is also famous in America for writing theses papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She does not want to show weakness to others, so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious, and when she builds interest, she pokes into things. Occasionally, she has views that differ from regular opinions, such as, "The experiment data is more important than the subject's privacy." Rintarou often tells her, "Hey, you've got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist," but she is not one to agree to such things personally. She is a tsundere.</td>

                    <td>16</td>
                    <td>Second year in Kasensou Private Preparatory Academy. Childhood friend of Rintarou's, and slow by nature. Speaks in a very wavy manner, and seems to always be smiling and having fun. She's quite the optimist. She has trouble understanding complicated theories, but doesn't mind as long as it's enjoyable. Doesn't like people arguing, and is depressed when things are unpleasant. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        Though she'd like to ease the situation in such cases, she's not really good at reading between the lines. She often went with her grandmother to see the stars on her grandmother's back. Because of that, she has a habit of reaching her arm out to the sky at times, which has led Rintarou to naming it the "Stardust Shakehand." She abruptly does this (even if she's talking with someone), which surprises everyone around her.</td>

                    <td>19</td>
                    <td>First year student in Tokyo Denki University. Pro-active otaku, who's got a thing for both 2-D and 3-D girls. Talks quite a lot, and uses @ch (a spin-off of 2ch) terminology. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou's ridiculous requests as "annoying," but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn't mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn't like it when people call him Super Haker). He's always in front of the computer.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Has the nickname <i> "Daru" (ダル) </i>, abbreviated after his name.</td>

                        A girl that really likes riding bicycles,
                         and is quite energetic, though a little crude. If you stick around her, she's surprisingly cautious. She is very helpful and a little too familiar with things, but doesn't dig too deep. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        She's also not quite comfortable with having other people help her. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. She is proactive and has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she's purposely doing so. She ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.
